# Ctrl+Video

A simple, local, and privacy-focused video downloader.

Ctrl+Video is a lightweight video downloader that runs locally in your browser, providing a clean and easy-to-use interface for downloading videos. Unlike online downloader websites, Ctrl+Video does not rely on external servers, does not collect any user data, and gives you full control over the download process.

The project uses yt-dlp as its only back-end dependency to handle video downloads.

Look into [Ctrl+Video's back-end Repo](https://github.com/EmiChristie/ctrl_video_back) for the back-end code.
